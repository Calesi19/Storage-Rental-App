# Storage-Rental-App

## Overview

I’ve been brainstorming ideas for my project. I wanted to give you a quick pitch on one and see if it’s viable. So far, my plan is to explore more back-end and cloud technology in my career as I graduate; Aside from that, I also would like to invest in real estate and possibly even start a rentable storage business at some point later on.
When renting a storage locker, many times you have to go into the office, fill out some paperwork, and get a physical key. For my senior project, I was thinking of creating the entire system, so that clients could do the entire process paperless and without a physical key, all through an app. The app will keep track of how many lockers they have rented out and their payments. Similar to an authenticator app, the codes for the lockers can update every few seconds to insure more security and they could have the option to create an expiring code incase they would like to share the access with someone else temporarily.
For the project, I’m not yet set on what specific programming languages I’d like to use; but I figure implementing some cloud database, using React Native/Flutter for the app, and programming language that are new to me for the backend and logic of it all.
To be honest, I’m not extremely passionate about front-end programming; but I don’t think an app like that would be too complicated. I’d also be making the software that would run on the locks for the lockers and access gates to the storage building (to show that locks open when they are supposed to). I believe the project would also help me learn some principles about security in software.
There is even some stretch challenges that could be implemented, like maybe using the phone’s NFC to open locks/gates, and administrator tools.
